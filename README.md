# Scratch SenseHat Collect Dots
A game where you collect dots

This game is for the Raspberry Pi with the Sense Hat
Using either the keys on the keyboard on the small joystick on the Sense Hat move your blue dot to collect as many red dots in the allocated time.

If the Raspberry Pi is attached to a monitor and the Scratch program is running you can see the countdown of the timer and the running score.
